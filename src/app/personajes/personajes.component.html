        humor. Now working with the Wardens to keep the peace in Piltover Crest
        icon.png Piltover, she wields mighty hextech gauntlets gauntlets that
        can punch through walls—and suspects—with equal ease.

        Renowned as its finest peacekeeper, Caitlyn Caitlyn is also Piltover
        Crest icon.png Piltover’s best shot at ridding the city of its elusive
        criminal elements. She is often paired with Vi Vi, acting as a cool
        counterpoint to her partner’s more impetuous nature. Even though she

        her superior intellect, allowing her to lay elaborate traps for any
        lawbreakers foolish enough to operate in the City of Progress.
